# Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior.
- Handle missing values and perform feature engineering.
- Train machine learning models to predict purchase amounts.
- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Machine Learning Models**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Normalize/scale numerical features
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze purchase patterns
   - Visualize customer demographics
3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create meaningful features from existing data
   - Remove redundant or highly correlated features
4. **Model Training & Evaluation**:
   - Train multiple models and tune hyperparameters
   - Compare performance using RMSE and RÂ² score

## Results
- Achieved an **X% improvement** in prediction accuracy compared to baseline models.
- Identified key factors influencing purchase behavior, such as **age group and product category**.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement deep learning models for improved accuracy.
- Integrate real-time sales data for dynamic predictions.
- Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI.


## Conclusion:
- In this project, we tried to build a model using various algorithms such as Linear regression, KNN regression, Decision tree regression, Random forest and XGB regressor to get the best possible prediction.
- The hyperparameter tuned XGB regressor gives us the best rmse value and r2 score for this problem.
